TO DO

[ ] Make version of logo with black outline and filled with gold

[ ] Make nav button column to content column ration 1/4 to 3/4 instad of 1/3 to 2/3 as move to larger screens, e.g. col-xl-4 & col-xl-8 so that we get smaller menu area

    [ ] Header with logo and title and full name
    [ ] Navigation button in center section, left two-thirds, or possibly one . third in larger sizes, or full width buttons in the smaller sizes

[ ] Create a home page with "About" information and the upcoming meetings

[ ] Create an events page with information about meeting further out, and eventually pen-related events such as Fountain Pen Day, Pelikan Hub, Pen Show dates, and much more (there are a surprising number of National Days and World Days related to writing instruments, writing, etc. 

[ ] Create a contact page with full contact information for the various city chapter coordinator and the group in general. 

[ ] Create a chapters page listing the chapters available.  We've gone from one to three in about the same number of years, consider the Omaha-based Midlands Pen Club our "Western" chapter, and are trying to get chapters started in other cities such as near the Sheaffer Pen Museum in Southeast Iowa where there's a large cluster of members who are too far away (2-3 hour drives) to make our current chapter meetings in centeral and eastern Iowa.

OTHER TASKS


[ ] Contact IowaPen East leader Danielle Chargo for permission to use the logo she designed and get a clear version if avaialble (Photoshop?)
[x] Make transparent version of logo
    [x] Turn outline of logo from black to gold
    [x] Decide on background color (brown? dark green? Dark red?)
[x] Use gradients to make logo and larger display text appear to have shading like fountain pen inks often do.
[ ] Can I apply gradients on a character by character basis? Use <span> for each letter of the title and maybe subtitle? Time consuming work, but might be very cool and appropriate.
[ ] As we get into databases, create a pen quote database and read one randomly each time the page is refreshed, display in the header or footer.
